# Privacy and retention

## What a click stores

| Stored | Not stored |
|---|---|
| time | IP address |
| `visitor`: `HMAC-SHA256(HASH_SECRET, ip + "\n" + user agent)`, first 32 hex chars | user agent string |
| referrer **host** (`instagram.com`) | full referrer URL, query strings |
| device class (`mobile`, `desktop`, `bot`, `other`) | cookies (none are set), geolocation |

The hash lets the statistics count distinct visitors and repeat visits, but nobody can recover an address from the log without `HASH_SECRET`, and the same visitor produces a different hash on every deployment with a different secret. Rotating `HASH_SECRET` resets unique-visitor continuity; it does not affect counts.

Referrers from the service's own host are dropped (the preview page's **Continue** button is `rel="noreferrer"` anyway).

## Retention

`CLICK_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 365): older click rows are deleted hourly. The `clicks` counter and `lastClickAt` on each link are kept forever, so lifetime totals survive; only per-day series, referrers and devices are bounded.

## Visitors' exposure to destinations

The redirect sends `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`, so destinations see the short URL as referrer on HTTPS→HTTPS, nothing on HTTPS→HTTP. The preview page sends none.

## Robots

`/robots.txt` disallows everything: crawlers should not index short URLs or preview pages, and preview pages carry `noindex` as well.
